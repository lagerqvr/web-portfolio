            "I'm Rasmus Lagerqvist, a final year Information Technology student at Arcada University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki, Finland. Diving into the software development scene in 2019, it's been a whirlwind of learning and coding ever since. Always been a tech enthusiast, and the more I explore, the more I realize how much there is to discover even though it can be scary at times.\n\
            What really keeps me going? Real-world problems and crafting solutions that make a difference. After all, that's what it's all about, right?",

        interests: [
            "As previously mentioned, I'm driven by problem-solving, no matter the stack. Currently my strongsuit is web-development, but I'm looking into DevOps and Cybersecurity, both of which I feel I can contribute in, especially when I learn more. Thus far I've created various full-stack projects which all are purpose made\n\
            to serve a purpose or solve a real-world problem.Dynamic and robust applications are also something I strive to create in order to better the space I'm in but also to hopefully help somebody else out.",
