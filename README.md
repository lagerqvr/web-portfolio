A web portfolio built with Typescript, Next.js, and styled with Tailwind. Deployed on Vercel.

## About The Project
Welcome to my (updated) personal portfolio, built using Next.js. For a long time, I had the urge to create a web portfolio to showcase some of my skills, experience, and projects. Life had other plans and I found myself constantly caught up in other obligations. However, I finally took the plunge and decided to put my portfolio into existence.
